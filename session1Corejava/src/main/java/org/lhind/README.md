## Exercise 1

Write a Java application which can manage survey data. The application needs to fulfill the following requirements:

- A survey can have multiple Questions, and can be taken by multiple candidates. A survey also has general survey information such as Title, Topic, Description.
- Each question has the possible alternatives which can be selected and the candidates can either choose one of the alternatives or decide not to answer a question.
  - The alternatives are the same for every question:
    - Agree
    - Slightly Agree
    - Slightly Disagree
    - Disagree
- Each candidate has the personal information such as First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone Number etc.
- The application should implement the following functions given the data structure described above:
  - Find the most given answer on a survey.
  - Print a surveyâ€™s result (meaning the number of each answer for each question).
  - Find the answers given by a candidate on a survey.
  - Find the candidate who has taken the most surveys.
  - Add/remove a question to an existing survey.
  - Check if a question is answered by less than 50% of the candidates and then remove it from the survey.
  - Validate the survey:
    - Must have at least 10 questions.
    - Can have at most 40 questions.
    - Each question has to be unique.
