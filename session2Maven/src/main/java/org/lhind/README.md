## Exercise 2

- Create a public GIT Repository using the GitHub host [https://github.com](https://github.com).
- Upload the project given in the first session to the repository.
- Make the project a maven project by keeping in mind the folder structure of a maven project.
- Try to add some dependencies if they are needed:
  - `org.apache.commons:commons-lang3` can use the `StringUtils` to verify that entered values are not blank (e.g. entered questions, survey title, description, etc).
- Run `mvn clean install` to build your project.
- Use feature branches to implement the features of this exercise and create a Pull Request for merging the changes on the main branch.
